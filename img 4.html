<p>Day in our country. On this day in 1950, the constitution of our country was formally adopted and India became a fully sovereign state. The fundamental law of the country, the Constitution, was enacted out of the diligence and hard work of great men like Mahatma Gandhi and the numerous freedom fighters who fought and sacrificed their lives for the independence of our country. So, the 26th of January was declared a National holiday and has been recognized and celebrated as the Republic Day of India ever since.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that January 26 had a great significance in India’s struggle for Swaraj. The Congress Session at Lahore on December 29, 1929, had passed a resolution declaring Purna Swaraj (Complete Independence) as India’s goal. It was also decided that the 26th of January should be observed all over India as Purna Swaraj Day. The complete Independence Day was for the first time celebrated on January 26th, 1930. It continued to be so observed until 1947. On achieving Independence, August 15 became our Independence Day.</p>
<p>Republic Day is celebrated with much enthusiasm in India, and we should remember the long journey to freedom and the struggles of our forefathers to transform the country into a sovereign nation. It is a day for all Indians to celebrate the essence of liberty and help India accomplish its freedom fighters' dreams. In celebration of Republic Day, citizens are encouraged to display their patriotism and pride. The students pledge to live as good citizens and help make their country a happier and more peaceful one.</p>
