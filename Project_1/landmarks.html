        <h2 align="right">One of the centres of attraction of Muzaffarpur is Baba Garibnath Temple which resides in the heart of the city. The
        temple is home to the Shivling of Lord Shiva as Baba Gareebnath. Legend has it that the Shivaling was acquired from the
        Peepal Tree where the Temple now stands. The man who cut down the tree witnessed blood oozing out of the tree, revealing
        the Shivling which compelled him to build the shrine that now attracts a large number of devotees. Baba Gareebnath
        Temple is especially crowded during the holy month of Shravan. </h2>
